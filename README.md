# Gent-et-al-2025-A-Modified-Disease-Risk-Index-for-Hop-Powdery-Mildew-PhytoFrontiers-
This repository contains data and SAS code needed to reproduce the analysis presented in Gent et al. 2025, submitted to PhytoFrontiers. The data set is from five years of experiments conducted to: (1) field validate a modified risk index for the foliar phase of hop powdery mildew and (2) understand the impact of varying the date of the final fungicide application of the year on the cone phase of the disease. Experiments were conducted in Washington State during 2020 to 2023 and 2018 to 2022, respectively.
